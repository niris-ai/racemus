Open source software empowers individuals and organizations to collaborate, innovate, and create solutions that benefit society as a whole.

Feel free to use and contribute to this open source project, and help us make a positive impact in the world of smart agriculture!

## Project Structure
The project is divided into four subdirectories:
- **Peronospora**: contains the predictive models for Plasmopara viticola.
- **NHH**: contains the predictive model for phenological phases.
- **Drone**: contains the project and configuration for the open-hardware drone "HERMES-00" by NIRIS and UNITN-DII. 
The specific license for this subdirectory can be found in the [LICENSE file](./drone/LICENSE) within the "Drone" directory.
- **RacemusClassifier**: includes the integration of the ResNet50 model, which is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. The code developed specifically for the RacemusClassifier, excluding the ResNet50 model, is released under the MIT License. For more information about these licenses, please refer to the following links:
  - [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
  - [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Please note that while the RacemusClassifier's custom code is licensed under MIT, the usage of ResNet50 model follows the terms and conditions of the Apache 2.0 License. Users of RacemusClassifier should comply with both licenses accordingly.
